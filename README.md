# Guess-it-2

## Project Description

Guess-it-2 is a number-range predictor designed to approximate the range within which the next number in a dataset would fall. It does so by applying linear regression, average and variance.

## About The Project
The intention of this project is to present some statistical calculations and scripting that will offer a simple, yet effective way to guess the range of the next number based on recent data points

## Getting Started
Follow these simple steps and get a local copy up and running.

### Prerequisites
- Go installed on your local machine.
- A terminal or command prompt to run the script.


### Installation

## Usage

To use guess-it-2, follow these steps:

1. Run the script

    ```sh
    go run .
    ```
2. Provide input:

   Enter a sequence of numbers, one per line. The program will print out the predicted range for the next number in the sequence.

   Example:

``` console
189
113
75 227
121
72 209
114
70 197
145
78 193
110
75 188

```

## RoadMap
 Improve the statistical methods for range prediction.
 Implement different window sizes for comparison.
 Add support for other statistical models.
 Include a web-based interface for ease of use.
